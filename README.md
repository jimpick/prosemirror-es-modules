Uses a forked set of prosemirror npm modules with support for loading ES modules directly off of the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) using it's experimental
support for ES modules and the "module" property in package.json.

This is based on the [basic example](http://prosemirror.net/examples/basic/) from the [ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net) website.

You can edit index.js and click "show" at the top of the page to view the results.
